# Project Master Document: MelateRetro

**Main Domain:** gonzaloronzon.com

**Project Description:** Melate Retro Statistical Analyzer

## Project Overview

This project provides data-driven insights for the "Melate Retro" lottery, going beyond simple random selection.  A GitHub Actions pipeline automates web scraping (`firebase_scraper.py`), statistical modeling (`precompute_analysis.py`), and brute-force analysis (`brute_force_analyzer.py`) of all 3.2 million combinations.  Results are served to a vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS frontend via Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Hosting). Key features include an interactive historical data dashboard, a 9-rule weighted combination scoring engine, and tools for play generation, rating, and backtesting.  Future architectural considerations include container orchestration with Docker for increased flexibility and potential cost savings, and a shift towards a microservices architecture to facilitate isolated changes and improvements.

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js
* **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Hosting), Python
* **Data Processing:** Python, GitHub Actions
* **Containerization (Future):** Docker
* **Machine Learning:**  Scikit-learn (potentially), XGBoost (potentially)
* **Payments:** Stripe
* **Monitoring (Future):** Firebase Performance Monitoring, potentially external services


## Next Steps & Roadmap

1. **Monetization & Subscription Management:** Implement a subscription model with premium features.
2. **Frontend Refactoring & UX Enhancement:** Improve code organization, user experience, and mobile responsiveness. Implement user onboarding.
3. **Machine Learning Integration:** Develop a model for optimized weight prediction.
4. **Centralized State Management:** Implement a robust state management solution in the frontend.
5. **Security Enhancements:** Implement XSS protections, secure Firestore data, and ensure compliance with data protection regulations, particularly for Stripe integration.
6. **DevOps Enhancements:** Integrate automated testing (unit and integration tests) into the CI/CD pipeline, establish a staging environment, and incorporate monitoring solutions.


## Task Breakdown & Estimation

### 1. Monetization & Subscription Management (40-60 hours)

* - [ ] Integrate Stripe API for payment processing (16-24 hours)
* - [ ] Implement Firebase user roles and permission management (8-12 hours)
* - [ ] Create subscription tiers and pricing logic in Firebase (8-12 hours)
* - [ ] Implement subscription lifecycle management (activation, cancellation, upgrades/downgrades) in Firebase (8-12 hours)


### 2. Frontend Refactoring & UX Enhancement (36-48 hours)

* - [ ] Refactor `index.html` JavaScript into ES modules (`ui.js`, `firestoreApi.js`, `ratingEngine.js`, `state.js`) (12-18 hours)
* - [ ] Implement interactive charts using Chart.js to visualize statistical distributions (8-12 hours)
* - [ ] Improve UI/UX for mobile responsiveness (8-12 hours)
* - [ ] Implement user onboarding/tooltips (4-6 hours)
* - [ ] Implement user preference saving (4-6 hours)



### 3. Machine Learning Model for Weight Optimization (40-60 hours)

* - [ ] Create a historical training dataset from past Melate Retro results (8-12 hours)
* - [ ] Generate a large dataset of random combinations as negative examples (4-6 hours)
* - [ ] Implement and train a classification model (Logistic Regression or XGBoost) using Python and Scikit-learn/XGBoost (16-24 hours)
* - [ ] Integrate the trained model into the rating engine via a Firebase Function or similar (8-12 hours)
* - [ ] Implement a mechanism for retraining and updating the model periodically (4-6 hours)


### 4. Centralized State Management (16-24 hours)

* - [ ] Design and implement a centralized state object/pattern (e.g., using a simple JavaScript object or a lightweight library) (8-12 hours)
* - [ ] Refactor existing code to read from and update the central state (8-12 hours)

### 5. Security Enhancements (24-36 hours)

* - [ ] Implement XSS protections (8-12 hours)
* - [ ] Secure Firestore data with appropriate security rules (8-12 hours)
* - [ ] Ensure compliance with data protection regulations, particularly for Stripe integration (8-12 hours)

### 6. DevOps Enhancements (24-36 hours)

* - [ ] Implement unit tests for Python scripts (8-12 hours)
* - [ ] Implement integration tests for core application functionality (8-12 hours)
* - [ ] Set up a staging environment (4-6 hours)
* - [ ] Integrate Firebase Performance Monitoring or other monitoring solutions (4-6 hours)




## Future Features (Beyond Next Steps)

* **User Community Features:** Forum or chat for users to discuss strategies and share insights.
* **Personalized Recommendations:**  Tailored recommendations based on user's past plays and preferences.
* **Real-time Data Updates:** Push notifications or live updates of latest results and analysis.
* **Advanced Filtering and Sorting:** More granular control over data displayed in the dashboard.
* **Alternative Lottery Support:** Expand to support other lotteries beyond Melate Retro.


## Risk Assessment

* **Data Source Reliability:** Dependence on web scraping could be disrupted by changes to the source website. Mitigation: Implement robust error handling and explore alternative data sources.
* **Firebase Costs:** Increased usage could lead to higher Firebase costs. Mitigation: Monitor usage closely and optimize data storage/retrieval strategies.  Consider alternative backend solutions (e.g., Dockerized microservices) for long-term cost optimization.
* **Model Accuracy:** Machine learning model may not achieve desired accuracy. Mitigation: Continuous monitoring and retraining of the model, potentially exploring more advanced model architectures.
* **Security Vulnerabilities:**  Potential for security breaches due to insufficient security measures. Mitigation: Implement robust security measures including XSS protection, secure data storage, and regular security audits.



## Communication Plan

* **Weekly progress reports:**  Shared via email or project management tool.
* **Regular team meetings:** To discuss roadblocks and coordinate efforts.
* **GitHub Issues:** Used for tracking bugs and feature requests.
* **User Feedback Collection:** Regularly solicit feedback from users to inform UI/UX improvements.
