# Project Master Document: MelateRetro

**Project Name:** MelateRetro
**Main Domain:** gonzaloronzon.com
**Description:** Melate Retro Statistical Analyzer

## Project Overview

This project is a fully-automated statistical analysis platform for the "Melate Retro" lottery, designed to provide users with data-driven insights that surpass simple random selection. The core system is a highly efficient data processing pipeline built on GitHub Actions, automating web scraping (`firebase_scraper.py`), pre-computing statistical models (`precompute_analysis.py`), and running brute-force analysis (`brute_force_analyzer.py`). Results are served to a modular JavaScript and Tailwind CSS frontend via a Firebase backend (Firestore, Authentication, Hosting). Key user-facing features include an interactive dashboard, a 9-rule weighted engine, and tools to generate, rate, and backtest potential plays. The architecture will be refactored to improve maintainability and scalability, addressing potential vendor lock-in concerns.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Hosting), Firebase Functions (expanded use planned)
- **Frontend:** JavaScript (ES Modules), Tailwind CSS, Chart.js
- **Data Processing:** Python (GitHub Actions)
- **Payment Gateway:** Stripe
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## Future Features (Zero-Cost Principle & Scalability)

The following features will be implemented leveraging existing resources and open-source tools to maintain a zero-cost development approach. Focus will be on improving existing functionality, user experience, and scalability, mitigating vendor lock-in risks.

### Phase 1: Monetization, UX Improvements & Architectural Refinement

- **Implement Stripe Integration (Securely):** Integrate Stripe for subscription management with server-side processing of sensitive payment data to enhance security.
  - [ ] Setup Stripe account and obtain API keys (2 hours)
  - [ ] Implement secure Firebase functions for subscription handling and server-side Stripe processing (16-24 hours) (Increased time due to secure implementation)
  - [ ] Integrate Stripe checkout flow into the frontend (4-6 hours)
  - [ ] Implement premium user role and feature gating in Firebase (6-8 hours)
  - [ ] Implement robust error handling and logging for Stripe integration (4 hours)

- **Frontend Code Refactoring & Modularization:** Refactor the JavaScript codebase into modular ES modules with clear separation of concerns. This is crucial for long-term maintainability.
  - [ ] Refactor existing JavaScript into `ui.js`, `firestoreApi.js`, `ratingEngine.js`, `state.js`, and additional modules as needed (24-36 hours)
  - [ ] Implement unit tests for critical modules using Jest or similar framework (16-24 hours) (Increased time to incorporate testing)

- **Interactive Chart Implementation:** Replace data tables with interactive charts using Chart.js.
  - [ ] Integrate Chart.js library (2 hours)
  - [ ] Convert existing data visualizations to charts (8-12 hours)

- **Implement CI/CD Pipeline:** Integrate a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment. (8-12 hours)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Statistical Engine & Backend Refactoring

- **Develop Machine Learning Model:** Replace the heuristic weighting system with a machine learning model. This will use existing data and open-source libraries.
  - [ ] Prepare historical training dataset (4-6 hours)
  - [ ] Implement Logistic Regression or XGBoost model (12-16 hours)
  - [ ] Integrate the ML model into the rating engine (8-12 hours)
  - [ ] Evaluate model performance and adjust parameters (4-6 hours)

- **Migrate Data Processing to Firebase Functions:** Migrate computationally intensive tasks, such as model training and statistical analysis, to Firebase Cloud Functions for improved performance and scaling. (16-24 hours)

### Phase 3: State Management, Refinement & Usability Testing

- **Implement Centralized State Management:** Replace global variables with a centralized state management pattern (e.g., Redux, Zustand, or Context API).
  - [ ] Design and implement centralized state object (12-16 hours) (Increased time for robust solution)
  - [ ] Refactor existing functions to use the centralized state (16-24 hours)
  - [ ] Implement thorough testing to ensure data consistency (8-12 hours) (Increased time for comprehensive testing)

- **Usability Testing & Improvements:** Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback and implement improvements based on findings. (8-16 hours)
- **Implement User Onboarding and Tooltips:** Create onboarding materials to guide new users through the application's functionalities. (4-8 hours)

## Task Breakdown & Estimation

This section provides a breakdown of the tasks outlined above with estimated time commitments. These estimates are approximate and may vary based on unforeseen complexities.

- [ ] implement-stripe-integration (40-52 hours) (Increased time due to security considerations)
- [ ] frontend-code-refactoring (40-48 hours) (Increased time to incorporate testing)
- [ ] implement-interactive-charts (10-14 hours)
- [ ] develop-machine-learning-model (30-40 hours)
- [ ] implement-centralized-state-management (32-40 hours) (Increased time for robust solution and testing)
- [ ] implement-ci-cd-pipeline (8-12 hours)
- [ ] migrate-data-processing-to-firebase-functions (16-24 hours)
- [ ] usability-testing-and-improvements (8-16 hours)
- [ ] implement-user-onboarding-and-tooltips (4-8 hours)

## Risk Assessment

- **Stripe Integration Complexity:** Unexpected issues with Stripe API integration. Mitigation: Thorough testing, robust error handling, server-side processing of sensitive data, and detailed documentation review.
- **ML Model Performance:** The ML model may not significantly improve prediction accuracy. Mitigation: Explore alternative models, hyperparameter tuning, and rigorous model evaluation.
- **Refactoring Challenges:** Unforeseen complexities during frontend and backend refactoring. Mitigation: Incremental refactoring, thorough testing, and clear modular design.
- **Firebase Dependency:** Over-reliance on Firebase might lead to vendor lock-in. Mitigation: Strategic use of Firebase Functions to handle intensive tasks and gradual architectural shifts toward a more distributed system as needed.

## Success Metrics

- Successful, secure Stripe integration and revenue generation.
- Improved user engagement and satisfaction through enhanced UX and usability testing.
- Significant improvement in prediction accuracy with the ML model.
- Stable and maintainable codebase with centralized state management and modular architecture.
- Automated CI/CD pipeline ensuring code quality and rapid deployment.
- Enhanced system performance and scalability through efficient backend processing with Firebase Functions.
